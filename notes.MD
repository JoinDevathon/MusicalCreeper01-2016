# Ideas

 * Some kind of automation machine using chests and whatnot
 * Something like Minefactory with conveyor belts and basic automation. - resourcepacks? resourcepacks.
 * Redstone logic gates
 * Security things - Cameras, sensors, etc - can use heads
 * Some kind of factory minigame - heads
 * Workshop machines that improve operation efficiency. e.g. table saw turns wood directly into slabs, creating 2x more slabs then crafting does
