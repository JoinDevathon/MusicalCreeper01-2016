# Processing Machines

Adds machines that enhance processing materials in Minecraft.

Use the resource pack for the best experience, with custom models and sounds. 

If not using the resource pack, stop the server and change `usemodels` in the config to `false` before creating any machines.

Everything else you need to know is in the in-game Wiki book that you are given when you login!
